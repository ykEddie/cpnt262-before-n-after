With this assignment I think I got a good grasp of the basic components we've been learning so far. Overall it wasn't too difficult but I did have some parts where I struggled
  
  - When trying to increment my age it kept doing it before the console log so for example if I set my current age to 19, it would print out that I am 20 instead of it saying I will be turning 20
  - I figured out how to fix it by just putting the operator after the variable: `age++`

W3Schools was very useful and reading the info on this [page about operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators) gave me a better understanding as how to use them in my code

Personally think I need to do some more FreeCodeCamp because I'm getting it slowly but every now and then I forget how each variable is used and when to call on a variable to make it do something.
